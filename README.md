## A church orginization and connection app

This iPhone app (and later for Android) is a communications App for Church leaders which allows them to effectively and safely communicate with groups, and sub-groups of users, so it can be perfectly tailored to all your church communications needs.

There are three types of things in this app setup:

- Realms
- Groups (go inside Realms)
- Members (can be Administrators or Normal)

Here's basically how this works:

- Any Member can create a Realm, and is automatically an Administrators for that Realm.
- Any Member can apply for membership or admin access to a realm, and his/her request is sent to the origonal admin for that realm.
- Any Admin for a Realm can create groups under that realm, and also do posts to the entire realm or a group in that realm.
- Any Member that is part of a realm, admin or not, can comment on posts in that realm.
- If you are not part of a realm, you cannot view anything in that realm, only it's name, and submit an application to it.

Here's a helpful diagram that should make this structure clearer:
